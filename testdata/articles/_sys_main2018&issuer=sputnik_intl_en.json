            "text": "🇭🇺 Highlights of Hungarian PM Viktor Orban’s year-end press conference\n\n▪️ The conflict in Ukraine is precisely a special military operation since Russia never declared war on the regime in Kiev, and did not announce general mobilization;  \n\n▪️ The European Union should not begin accession talks with Ukraine since the conflict there is ongoing;\n\n▪️ Orban queried whether the EU intends to accept Ukraine along with the new Russian regions;\n\n▪️ It is not in Hungary’s interests to have a border with Russia;\n\n▪️ The launch of accession talks between the European Union and Ukraine is no more than a political gesture, and fails to bring tangible help to the citizens of that country;\n\n▪️ Ukraine cannot be admitted to the EU without the decision of the Hungarian parliament;\n\n▪️Orban stressed he opposed the start of accession talks with Kiev at the EU summit on December 14-15, but could not persuade the remaining 26 EU leaders to change their minds;\n\n▪️EU member countries cannot decide to allocate financial support to Ukraine from the bloc’s budget without the consent of Hungary. They can only agree on extra-budgetary payments, as would be the case if the other 26 countries took out a common loan for this purpose;\n\n▪️The EC has no reason to attempt to strip Hungary of its voting rights under Article 7 of the EU treaty (for violations of the rule of law), since it has just admitted that the country’s judicial system is in order;\n\n▪️The new EU migration rules are flawed and were adopted not unanimously, but by a simple majority.\n\nSubscribe to @geopolitics_live",

So if you want to push Russia out of Europe altogether, you have to deal with the ‘Serbia problem’. They came close from 2000 on, when you had the color revolution that overthrew [Slobodan] Milosevic. And then for the next eight years, they had this opposition that ruled and then the West recognized the independence of Kosovo. So they came close, but they couldn't quite pull this off. And so this has been an ongoing thing to try to rectify the unfinished business from the 1990s,” Szamuely said."

But somehow the opposition in Serbia decided to blame the government for it. So they held these mass protests demanding elections…Vucic said, okay, fine, we’ll have elections, so they had the elections.

The new deal removed intermediaries, bringing down costs. However, the detained official extended the previous contract, with a sum of around 1.5 billion hryvnias ($40 million) finding its way to an intermediary firm’s account. The artillery shells have not yet been delivered.\n\nRecently, Europe failed to produce and ship a million shells to Kiev, exacerbating the already tangible “shell hunger” of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.\n\nSubscribe to @geopolitics_live",

Ukrainian forces, including paramilitaries from the infamous neo-Nazi Azov Regiment, recaptured Maryinka in August 2014. From that time on, the strategic town, situated directly on the western outskirts of Donetsk City, was turned into a seemingly impenetrable fortress, and used by Ukrainian forces to launch regular, indiscriminate attacks against the militia-controlled city. Battles for the settlement by Donetsk People's Republic militias, now backed by the regular Russian military, began immediately after the start of Russia's special military operation in February 2022. Images of the settlement today show that it has been turned into a pile of ruins, with most civilians living in the town leaving after 2014, and the rest evacuated after 2022.</p>",

Of this, 7.7 billion has been spent on liquefied natural gas (LNG), with the US cashing in the most on this. The remaining €7.5 billion were spent by the EU on pipeline gas. \n\nIt is estimated that EU member states over the course of 20 months spent a total of €304 billion on gas imports, while previously such expenses were accrued over several years.\n\nRussia, on the other hand, despite the reduction in gas export volumes, received an additional € 14 billion euros due to rising energy costs.\n\nSubscribe to @geopolitics_live",

The conditions are catastrophic, and those inside the hospital are crying out from thirst;\n\n▪️Snipers are everywhere with orders to shoot on sight, preventing movement between buildings; we have lost contact with our colleagues;\n\n▪️Israeli drones won't stop flying over the hospital;\n\n▪️The occupiers are currently holding several families in the hospital warehouse;\n\n▪️We will stay with the wounded and sick, and will leave only with them.
